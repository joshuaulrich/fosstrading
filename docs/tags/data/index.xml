Should we consider it good that rules are independent of model building? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. My goal in backtesting is to assign a PROBABILITY that a trade will move my favour &amp;ndash; and then size according to modified Kelly. @crasshopper: I think it would be more appropriate&amp;hellip; Brian G.

      <description>(This is a guest post by Ilya Kipnis)
When trading stocks in a single currency, instrument metadata can be safely ignored because the multiplier is 1 and the currencies are all the same.Â When doing analysis on fixed income products, options, futures, or other complex derivative instruments, the data defining the properties of these instruments becomes critical to tasks like accounting for value of trades, or comparing notional value between more than one instrument.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting a bit of traffic from people searching for opentick (the defunct company), so I&amp;rsquo;ve started a list of similar (but non-free) data providers.
I&amp;rsquo;m not affiliated with any of these vendors, and the list is in no particular order. I&amp;rsquo;ll update this post as more information becomes available.
IQFeed

      <description>After a year of &amp;ldquo;we plan to accept new subscribers shortly&amp;rdquo;, opentick has shut its doors completely. As of March 20th, the opentick service is no longer available.
From opentick.com:
 3/16/2009
To opentick subscribers, friends, supporters, contributors and the rest of the community&amp;hellip;
It has been quite a journey for opentick, and for those of you who have been with us for the ride we cannot thank you enough for the support, contributions and guidance you have given us over the course of the last 5 years.</description>

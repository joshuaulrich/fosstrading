      <description>Someone recently shared this great talk by Chris Allen from lambda conf 2017. The title of the talk is &amp;ldquo;Why Johnny Can&amp;rsquo;t Code Good,&amp;rdquo; but the content is more about how to grow as a programmer. His points are true whether you&amp;rsquo;re just starting out, or have been coding for years.
My notes from Chris&amp;rsquo; talk are below, in the order they appear in the presentation. My thoughts are in parentheses.</description>

      <title>R/Finance 2014 Review</title>
      <link>https://www.fosstrading.com/2014/06/rfinance-2014-review/</link>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been more than a month since R/Finance 2014, and my job has finally slowed down enough to allow me to write down my thoughts (though I&amp;rsquo;m writing this over two days during my train to and from Chicago).
The comments below are based on my personal experience. If I don&amp;rsquo;t comment on a seminar or presentation, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it or it wasn&amp;rsquo;t good; it may have been over my head or I may have been distracted with my duties as a committee member.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been one week since the 5th Annual R/Finance conference, and I finally feel sufficiently recovered enough to share my thoughts. The conference is a two-day whirlwind of applied quantitative finance, fantastic networking, and general geekery.
The comments below are based on my personal experience. If I don&amp;rsquo;t comment on a seminar or presentation, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it or it wasn&amp;rsquo;t good; it may have been over my head or I may have been distracted with my duties as a committee member.</description>

      <description>You have a problem: R is single-threaded, but your code would be faster if it could simultaneously run on more than one core. You have access to a cluster and/or your computer has multiple cores. Parallel R, by Q. Ethan McCallum and Stephen Weston, can help you put this extra computing power to use.
The book describes 6 approaches to distributed computing. Thoughts on each approach follow:
1) snow
 The chapter starts by showing you how to create a socket cluster on a single machine (later sections discuss MPI clusters, and socket clusters of several machines).</description>

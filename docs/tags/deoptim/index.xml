This is great work by Josh. If anyone would like to test this out before we send it to CRAN, see example code in the &amp;lsquo;sandbox&amp;rsquo; directory in the package source, also provided by Josh.
If you want to just see it working (though this won&amp;rsquo;t show any speed improvements), here is some minimal code.</description>

      <description>Running DEoptim in parallel has been on the development team&amp;rsquo;s wishlist for awhile. It had not been a priority though, because none of us have personally needed it. An opportunity arose when Kris Boudt approached me about collaborating to add this functionality as part of a consultancy project for a financial services firm.
We were able to add and test the functionality within a week. The latest revision of DEoptim on R-Forge has the capability to evaluate the objective function on multiple cores using foreach.</description>

      <description>The R Project has once again been selected as a mentoring organization for this year&amp;rsquo;s Google Summer of Code (GSoC). If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with GSoC, it&amp;rsquo;s a global program that offers students a stipend to write code for open source projects, under the direction of a mentor. Mentors get code written for their project, but no money. Students get something like a paid summer internship, with open-source contributions they can reference on their resume.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been more than a month since R/Finance 2014, and my job has finally slowed down enough to allow me to write down my thoughts (though I&amp;rsquo;m writing this over two days during my train to and from Chicago).
The comments below are based on my personal experience. If I don&amp;rsquo;t comment on a seminar or presentation, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it or it wasn&amp;rsquo;t good; it may have been over my head or I may have been distracted with my duties as a committee member.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been one week since the 5th Annual R/Finance conference, and I finally feel sufficiently recovered enough to share my thoughts. The conference is a two-day whirlwind of applied quantitative finance, fantastic networking, and general geekery.
The comments below are based on my personal experience. If I don&amp;rsquo;t comment on a seminar or presentation, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it or it wasn&amp;rsquo;t good; it may have been over my head or I may have been distracted with my duties as a committee member.</description>

      <description>This post is a slightly revised (and &amp;ldquo;blogified&amp;rdquo;) version of the message Brian Peterson has sent to various R mailing lists.
Once again, R has been accepted as a mentoring organization for the Google Summer of Code (2012). We invite students interested in this program to learn more about it. A good starting point is the R GSoC wiki.
Students participating in the program receive US$5,000 for successful completion of a GSoC project, a great resume item, and an opportunity to work with R package authors.</description>

We want to thank everyone who traveled to Chicago to make this happen. With nearly 200 attendees, coming from 8 countries and 20+ states in the US, the conference exceeded all of our expectations. A very big thank you to our presenters for taking the time to join us, UIC&amp;rsquo;s International Center for Futures and Derivatives for hosting the event, and our sponsors REvolution Computing and Microsoft for their support.</description>

      <description>The first international R/Finance 2009 conference in Chicago, IL was a huge success! David Smith from REvolution Computing has written a great summary of the entire event. I&amp;rsquo;ll take the lazy route and point you to his blog post. :)
 The first international conference dedicated to the use of R in the finance industry, R/Finance 2009, was a great success. With over 150 attendees (my poor estimation skills notwithstanding), sold-out tutorials, and an outstanding lineup of invited and contributing speakers from around the world, this event really demonstrated the importance of R in the world of financial analysis.</description>

      <description>Krishna Kumar, Jan Vecer and the great folks at REvolution computing put on a great event at the beautiful Columbia University campus on the Upper West Side of New York.
Presentations by Whit Armstrong, Anthony Brockwell, Bryan Lewis, Scott Payseur, Peter Carl, Brian Peterson, and our own Jeff Ryan made for an impressive display of the power of R in quant finance. Jeff&amp;rsquo;s presentation slides can be found here.
Some great things are happening in this community, and we are certainly glad to be part of them.</description>

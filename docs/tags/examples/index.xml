      <description>I am trying to run this script in R-Studio on OSX &amp;hellip; Lemao - Aug 2, 2011I am trying to run this script in R-Studio on OSX but I am getting the following error:
&amp;gt; currency(&amp;ldquo;USD&amp;rdquo;)
Error in assign(primary_id, currency_temp, envir = as.environment(.instrument)) :
object &amp;lsquo;.instrument&amp;rsquo; not found
I have installed the dependencies: zoo, xts, TTR, RTAQ, quantstrat, quantmod, Performanceanalytics, FInancialInstrument, Defaults and blotter.
Any ideas of what is going wrong here?</description>

      <description>As promised in the introduction to quantstrat, here is an example strategy. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d start with the obligatory tactial asset allocation (TAA) strategy. This post will replicate the strategy in the post, tactical asset allocation using blotter.
The &amp;ldquo;faber&amp;rdquo; demo in the quanstrat package contains a TAA strategy but it uses a slightly different approach than the code we&amp;rsquo;re trying to replicate. There are two major differences:
  The blotter TAA code initiates a position at the first observation where the close is above the SMA.</description>

However, when I ran it, I got this error:
Error: could not find function &amp;ldquo;DVI&amp;rdquo;
I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get the DVI indicator out of TTR. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried installing the package from CRAN, using install.packages(&amp;lsquo;TTR&amp;rsquo;,dependencies=TRUE) and from r-forge, using install.packages(&amp;ldquo;TTR&amp;rdquo;,repos=&amp;quot;http://r-forge.r-project.org&amp;rdquo;). In both cases it installs fine, and other indicators work, but there&amp;rsquo;s no DVI indicator.</description>

      <description>This is the third post in the Backtesting in Excel and R series and it will show how to backtest a simple strategy in R. It will follow the 4 steps Damian outlined in his post on how to backtest a simple strategy in Excel.
Step 1: Get the data
The getSymbols function in quantmod makes this step easy if you can use daily data from Yahoo Finance. There are also &amp;ldquo;methods&amp;rdquo; (not in the strict sense) to pull data from other sources (FRED, Google, Oanda, R save files, databases, etc.</description>

This is much more efficient than coding + debugging + testing stuff in programming languages e.g. JAVA, Matlab, C++.
Thanks for the comment Rocko - I think what you&amp;rsquo;ll find is that as the complexity of a model goes up, you may want to look at other approaches as well!

Let me start by saying that I’m not an expert in backtesting in Excel – there are a load of very smart bloggers out there that have, as I would say, “mad skillz” at working with Excel including (but not limited to) Michael Stokes over at marketsci.com, Jeff Pietch over at etfprophet.com and the folks (David and Corey) over at cssanalytics.</description>

      <description>This post is the introduction to a series that will illustrate how to backtest the same strategy in Excel and R. The impetus for this series started with this tweet by Jared Woodard at Condor Options. After Soren Macbeth introduced us, Jared suggested backtesting a simple DVI strategy in Excel and R.
The three-post series will show you:

Thank you for providing the LSPM package - I would not have been able to experiment with using LSPM if I could not use the package. I would like to confirm two things:
 the maxUnits function has not been built in to the LSPM package - correct? what should one do if using leverage is not an option.</description>

      <description>When optimizing leverage space portfolios, I frequently run into the issue of one or more f$ ([Max Loss]/f) being less than the margin of its respective instrument. For example, assume the required margin for an instrument is $500, f$ is $100, and $100,000 in equity. The optimal amount to trade is 1,000 shares ($100,000/$100). However, that would require $500,000 in equity, while you only have $100,000. What do you do?</description>

The joint probabilities table (&amp;ldquo;jpt&amp;rdquo;) ultimately should encompass and be a proxy for all potential risk for the next period.
In other words, frequently, in attempting to articulate &amp;ldquo;risk,&amp;rdquo; we see the argument that it is more than mere variance. That there is liquidity risk, there is counter-party risk, this risk and that risk, and there is a notion that risk posses many facets.</description>

I might point out to that it is not just the optimization algorithms used, but in the case of mazimizing for greatest probability of profit, there are many posssible optimal sets (f1,..,fn,z+,z-). There are multiple sets which will result in an equivalent (and highest) probability of profit.
-Ralph Vince
If I understand the optimization problem correctly, I think it may be possible to achieve similar results in just minutes of computation with a different optimization approach.</description>

      <description>To continue with the LSPM examples, this post shows how to optimize a Leverage Space Portfolio for the maximum probability of profit. The data and example are again taken from The Leverage Space Trading Model by Ralph Vince.
These optimizaitons take a very long time. 100 iterations on a 10-core Amazon EC2 cluster took 21 hours. Again, the results will not necessarily match the book because of differences between DEoptim and Ralph&amp;rsquo;s genetic algorithm and because there are multiple possible paths one can take through leverage space that will achieve similar results.</description>

-&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;
port &amp;lt;- lsp(trades,probs, f=c(0.085,0.015,0.129), z = c(-0.76, -0.992, 0.0))
probDrawdown(port,0.8,12,13)
-&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;
This code shows me value 0.0001982222, but Vince says his dd is 0.</description>

      <description>My last post provided examples of how to use the LSPM package. Those who experimented with the code have probably found that constrained optimizations with horizons &amp;gt; 6 have long run-times (when calc.max &amp;gt;= horizon).
This post will illustrate how the snow package can increase the speed of the probDrawdown and probRuin functions on computers with multiple cores. This yields nearly linear improvements in run-times relative to the number of cores.</description>

In this long-overdue post, I will show how to optimize a Leverage Space Portfolio with the LSPM package. Please use the comments to let me know what you would like to see next.
Some copious notes before we get to the code:
These examples are based on revision 26 31 from r-forge and will not work under earlier revisions (and may not work with later revisions).</description>

If you like the RSI(2), be sure to check out David Varadi&amp;rsquo;s RSI(2) alternative!
This post will use the PerformanceAnalytics package to evaluate the rules that scale in/out of positions. I&amp;rsquo;ve also provided a simple function that provides some summary statistics.</description>

      <description>Though it&amp;rsquo;s more than two weeks later, here&amp;rsquo;s the second post in the series that will demonstrate how to build, test, and implement a trading strategy with R. You can find the first post here.
The first post replicated this simple RSI(2) strategy from the MarketSci Blog. This second post will demonstrate how to replicate this strategy that scales in/out of RSI(2).
A couple notes before moving to the code:</description>

      <description>Really cool. A lot of questions: &amp;ldquo;# Calcula&amp;hellip; Damian - Apr 3, 2009Really cool. A lot of questions:
&amp;ldquo;# Calculate the RSI indicator
rsi &amp;lt;- RSI(Cl(GSPC),2)&amp;rdquo;
When you reference the symbol for getting the data, you referenced it via &amp;ldquo;^GSPC&amp;rdquo; - how did it get assigned to GSPC?
Secondly, if I have the data stored locally, how would I reference it?
&amp;ldquo;# Lag signals to align with days in market,</description>

      <description>This is the first of a series of posts that will demonstrate how to build, test, and implement a trading strategy using my favorite FOSS, R. I chose the RSI(2) strategy because it has gotten considerable attention on trading blogs over the past 6 months.
In particular, I will be replicating and extending some of the results from Michael Stokes&amp;rsquo; excellent MarketSci Blog. This post will focus on replicating this simple RSI(2) strategy.</description>

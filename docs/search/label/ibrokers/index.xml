      <description>As the speaker says, R isn&amp;rsquo;t fast enough to do&amp;hellip; Anonymous - Oct 0, 2010As the speaker says, R isn&amp;rsquo;t fast enough to do HFT.
You really think anybody can beat the market using the same statistics packages as everybody else and being charged $1/trade?!
If by HFT, you mean is R fast enough to compete with Getco or Goldman, then the answer is clearly NO. That world is dominated by embedded computing, wire speed, and things like FPGA.</description>

      <description>Josh had kindly invited me to post on FOSS Trading around the time when he first came up with the idea for the blog. Fast forward a year and I am finally taking him up on his offer.
I&amp;rsquo;ll start by highlighting that while all the software in this post is indeed free (true to FOSS), an account with Interactive Brokers is needed to make use of it. For those not familiar with IB, they offer a trading platform that excels on numerous fronts but is most appealing to those of us who trade algorithmically.</description>

      <description>Jeff Ryan&amp;rsquo;s IBrokers package was mentioned on Ernie Chan&amp;rsquo;s blog, Quantitative Trading. Though the package is still in pre-alpha stage, it is generating quite a bit of interest.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting a bit of traffic from people searching for opentick (the defunct company), so I&amp;rsquo;ve started a list of similar (but non-free) data providers.

      <description>After a year of &amp;ldquo;we plan to accept new subscribers shortly&amp;rdquo;, opentick has shut its doors completely. As of March 20th, the opentick service is no longer available.

To opentick subscribers, friends, supporters, contributors and the rest of the community&amp;hellip;
It has been quite a journey for opentick, and for those of you who have been with us for the ride we cannot thank you enough for the support, contributions and guidance you have given us over the course of the last 5 years.</description>

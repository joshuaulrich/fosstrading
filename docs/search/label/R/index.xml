      <description>A new version of quantmod is on CRAN! One really cool thing about this release is that almost all the changes are contributions from the community.
Ethan Smith made more excellent contributions to getQuote() in this release. It no longer throws an error if one or more symbols are missing. And it handles multiple symbols in a semicolon-delimted string, just like getSymbols(). For example, you can get quotes for multiple symbols by calling getQuote(&amp;quot;SPY;AAPL&amp;quot;).</description>

      <title>microbenchmark_1.4-7 on CRAN</title>

      <description>I pushed an updated microbenchmark to CRAN a couple weeks ago. There were two noteworthy changes, thanks to great contributions from @MichaelChirico and @harvey131.
Michael fixed a bug in the check for whether the unit argument was a character string (#9, #10). The prior behavior was an uninformative error.
Harvey added a feature to allow you to use a string for common checks: &amp;ldquo;equal&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;identical&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;equivalent&amp;rdquo; (#16). So you don&amp;rsquo;t need to create a custom function to use all.</description>

      <description>I just pushed a new release of quantmod to CRAN! I&amp;rsquo;m most excited about the update to getSymbols() so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t throw an error and stop processing if there&amp;rsquo;s a problem with one ticker symbol. Now getSymbols() will import all the data it can, and provide an informative error message for any ticker symbols it could not import.
Another cool feature is that getQuote() can now import quotes from Tiingo. But don&amp;rsquo;t thank me; thank Ethan Smith for the feature request [#247] and pull request [#250].</description>

      <title>xts 0.11-2 on CRAN</title>

      <guid>https://blog.fosstrading.com/2018/11/xts-011-2-on-cran.html</guid>
      <description>xts version 0.11-2 was published to CRAN yesterday. xts provides data structure and functions to work with time-indexed data. This is a bug-fix release, with notable changes below:
 The xts method for shift.time() is now registered. Thanks to Philippe Verspeelt for the report and PR (#268, #273). An if-statement in the xts constructor will no longer try to use a logical vector with length &amp;gt; 1. Code like if (c(TRUE, TRUE)) will throw a warning in an upcoming R release, and this patch will prevent that warning.</description>

      <description>xts version 0.11-1 was published to CRAN this morning. xts provides data structure and functions to work with time-indexed data. This release contains some awesome features that will transparently make your xts code even faster!
 There&amp;rsquo;s a new window.xts() method, thanks to Corwin Joy (#100, #240). Corwin also refactored and improved the performance of the binary search algorithm used to subset xts objects. Tom Andrews reported and fixed a few related regressions (#251, #263, #264).</description>

      <title>Goodbye Google, Hello Tiingo!</title>

      <guid>https://blog.fosstrading.com/2018/04/goodbye-google-hello-tiingo.html</guid>
      <description>First, the bad news:
Google Finance no longer provides data for historical prices or financial statements, so we say goodbye to getSymbols.google() and getFinancials.google(). (#221) They are now defunct as of quantmod 0.4-13.
Now, the good news:
Thanks to Steve Bronder, getSymbols() can now import data from Tiingo! (#220) This feature is part of quantmod 0.4-13, which is now on CRAN. Windows and Mac binaries should be built in a day or two.</description>

      <description>This xts release contains mostly bugfixes, but there are a few noteworthy features. Some of these features were added in version 0.10-1, but I forgot to blog about it. Anyway, in no particular order:
 endpoints() gained sub-second accuracy on Windows (#202)! na.locf.xts() now honors x and xout arguments by dispatching to the next method (#215). Thanks to Morten Grum for the report. na.locf.xts() and na.omit.xts() now support character xts objects.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.fosstrading.com/2018/01/rquantlib-044-for-windows.html</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to announce that the RQuantLib Windows binaries are now up to 0.4.4! The RQuantLib pre-built Windows binaries have been frozen on CRAN since 0.4.2, but now you can get version 0.4.4 binaries on Dirk&amp;rsquo;s ghrr drat repo.
Installation is as simple as:
drat::addRepo(&amp;#34;ghrr&amp;#34;) # maybe use &amp;#39;install.packages(&amp;#34;drat&amp;#34;)&amp;#39; first  install.packages(&amp;#34;RQuantLib&amp;#34;, type=&amp;#34;binary&amp;#34;) I will be able to create Windows binaries for future RQuantLib versions too, now that I have a Windows QuantLib build (version 1.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Paul Teetor, getSymbols() can now import data from Alpha Vantage! This feature is part of the quantmod 0.4-11 release, and provides another another data source to avoid any Yahoo Finance API changes*.
Alpha Vantage is a free web service that provides real-time and historical equity data. They provide daily, weekly, and monthly history for both domestic and international markets, with up to 20 years of history. Dividend and split adjusted close prices are available for daily data.</description>

      <description>A new, and long overdue, release of xts is now on CRAN! The major change is the completely new plot.xts() written by Michael Weylandt and Ross Bennett, and which is based on Jeff Ryan&amp;rsquo;s quantmod::chart_Series() code.
Do note that the new plot.xts() includes breaking changes to the original (and rather limited) plot.xts(). However, we believe the new functionality more than compensates for the potential one-time inconvenience. And I will no longer have to tell people that I use plot.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.fosstrading.com/2017/06/quantmod-0-4-9-on-cran.html</guid>
      <description>A new release of quantmod is now on CRAN! The only change was to address changes to Yahoo! Finance and their effects on getSymbols.yahoo(). GitHub issue #157 contains some details about the fix implementation.
Unfortunately, the URL wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only thing that changed. The actual data available for download changed as well.
The most noticeable difference is that the adjusted close column is no longer dividend-adjusted (i.e. it&amp;rsquo;s only split-adjusted). Also, only the close price is unadjusted; the open, high, and low are split-adjusted.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.fosstrading.com/2017/04/quantmod-0-4-8-on-cran.html</guid>
      <description>I pushed a bug-fix release of quantmod to CRAN last night. The major changes were to
 getSymbols.FRED() (#141) getSymbols.oanda() (#144) getSymbols.yahoo() (#149)  All three providers made breaking changes to their URLs/interfaces.
getSymbols.google() also got some love. It now honors all arguments set via setSymbolLookup() (#138), and it correctly parses the date column in non-English locales (#140).
There&amp;rsquo;s a handy new argument to getDividends(): split.adjust. It allows you to request dividends unadjusted for splits (#128).</description>

      <title>Stack Financials: Analyze Financial Statement Data</title>

      <guid>https://blog.fosstrading.com/2017/02/stack-financials.html</guid>
      <description>A quantmod user asked an interesting question on StackOverflow: Looping viewFinancials from quantmod. Basically, they wanted to create a data.frame that contained financial statement data for several companies for several years. I answered their question, and thought others might find the function I wrote useful&amp;hellip; hence, this post!
I called the function stackFinancials() because it would use getFinancials() and viewFinancials() to pull financial statement data for multiple symbols, and stack them together in long form.</description>

      <description>CRAN just accepted a bugfix release of quantmod. The most pertinent changes were to fix getSymbols.oanda (#36) and getOptionChain.yahoo (#92). It also includes a fix to addTRIX (#72).
Oanda changed their URL format from http to https, and getSymbols.oanda did not follow the redirect. Yahoo Finance changed the HTML for displaying options data, which broke getOptionChain.yahoo. The fix downloads JSON instead of scraping HTML, so hopefully it will be less likely to break.</description>

      <description>This post is in response to Michael Harris&amp;rsquo; Price Action Lab post, where he uses some simple R code to evaluate the asymmetry of returns from the day&amp;rsquo;s close to the following day&amp;rsquo;s open. I&amp;rsquo;d like to respond to his 3 notes, which I&amp;rsquo;ve included below.
  The R backtest assumes fractional shares. This means that equity is fully invested at each new position. This is important because it affects drawdown calculations.</description>

      <description>I just sent quantmod_0.4-5 to CRAN, and TTR_0.23-0 has been there for a couple weeks. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank Ivan Popivanov for many useful reports and patches to TTR. He provided patches to add HMA (Hull MA), ALMA, and ultimateOscillator functions.
James Toll provided a patch to the volatility function that uses a zero mean (instead of the sample mean) in close-to-close volatility. The other big change is that moving average functions no longer return objects with column names based on the input object column names.</description>

      <description>We have been working on a new charting engine for xts::plot.xts for the past couple years. It started with Michael Weylandt&amp;rsquo;s work during the 2012 Google Summer of Code, and Ross Bennett took up the torch during the 2014 GSoC.
This new engine improves the functionality, modularity, and flexibility of plot.xtsby building off the framework Jeff Ryan began with q****uantmod::chart_Series. The modular framework allows users to plot an xts object and incrementally build custom charts by adding panels of new data (including transformations of the original xts object).</description>

      <description>I pushed quantmod 0.4-4 to CRAN this weekend. It adds a getSymbols.yahooj function to pull stock data from Yahoo Finance Japan, and fixes issues in getOptionChain.yahoo and getSymbols.oanda.
Changes to the Yahoo Finance and Oanda websites broke the getOptionChain.yahoo and getSymbols.oanda functions, respectively. I didn’t use getOptionChain.yahoo much, so I’m not certain I restored all the prior functionality. Let me know if there’s something I missed. I’d be glad to add a test case for that, or to add a test you’ve written.</description>

      <description>The R Project has once again been selected as a mentoring organization for this year&amp;rsquo;s Google Summer of Code (GSoC). If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with GSoC, it&amp;rsquo;s a global program that offers students a stipend to write code for open source projects, under the direction of a mentor. Mentors get code written for their project, but no money. Students get something like a paid summer internship, with open-source contributions they can reference on their resume.</description>

      <description>An updated version of quantmod has just been released on CRAN. This is my first submission as the new maintainer. The major change was removing the dependency on the now-archived Defaults package. End-users shouldn&amp;rsquo;t notice a difference, since I basically copied the necessary functionality from Defaults and added it to quantmod.
There are also several bug fixes. A few worth noting are:

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been more than a month since R/Finance 2014, and my job has finally slowed down enough to allow me to write down my thoughts (though I&amp;rsquo;m writing this over two days during my train to and from Chicago).
The comments below are based on my personal experience. If I don&amp;rsquo;t comment on a seminar or presentation, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it or it wasn&amp;rsquo;t good; it may have been over my head or I may have been distracted with my duties as a committee member.</description>

      <description>The complaint I hear most frequently about quantstrat is that it&amp;rsquo;s slow, especially for large data. Some of this slow performance is due to quantstrat treating all strategies as path-dependent by default. Path dependence requires rules to be re-evaluated for each timestamp with a signal. More signals equates to longer run-times.
If your strategy is not path-dependent, you can get a fairly substantial performance improvement by turning path-dependence off. If your strategy truly is path-dependent, keep reading&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been one week since the 5th Annual R/Finance conference, and I finally feel sufficiently recovered enough to share my thoughts. The conference is a two-day whirlwind of applied quantitative finance, fantastic networking, and general geekery.

If I don&amp;rsquo;t comment on a seminar or presentation, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it or it wasn&amp;rsquo;t good; it may have been over my head or I may have been distracted with my duties as a committee member.</description>

Join me in getting a good refresher on basic statistics, simulation and bootstrapping, linear algebra, and learning more about portfolio optimization, efficient portfolios, and risk budgeting.</description>

      <description>The Google Summer of Code (2012) project to extend xts has produced a very promising new plot.xts function. Michael Weylandt, the project&amp;rsquo;s student, wrote R-SIG-Finance to request impressions, feedback, and bug reports. The function is housed in the xtsExtra package of the xts project on R-Forge.
Please try xtsExtra::plot.xts and let us know what you think. A sample of the eye-candy produced by the code in Michael&amp;rsquo;s email is below. Granted, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a one-liner, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly impressive!</description>

      <description>You have a problem: R is single-threaded, but your code would be faster if it could simultaneously run on more than one core. You have access to a cluster and/or your computer has multiple cores. Parallel R, by Q. Ethan McCallum and Stephen Weston, can help you put this extra computing power to use.
The book describes 6 approaches to distributed computing. Thoughts on each approach follow:
 snow   The chapter starts by showing you how to create a socket cluster on a single machine (later sections discuss MPI clusters, and socket clusters of several machines).</description>

      <description>This post is a slightly revised (and &amp;ldquo;blogified&amp;rdquo;) version of the message Brian Peterson has sent to various R mailing lists.
Once again, R has been accepted as a mentoring organization for the Google Summer of Code (2012). We invite students interested in this program to learn more about it. A good starting point is the R GSoC wiki.
Students participating in the program receive US$5,000 for successful completion of a GSoC project, a great resume item, and an opportunity to work with R package authors.</description>

      <description>Running DEoptim in parallel has been on the development team&amp;rsquo;s wishlist for awhile. It had not been a priority though, because none of us have personally needed it. An opportunity arose when Kris Boudt approached me about collaborating to add this functionality as part of a consultancy project for a financial services firm.
We were able to add and test the functionality within a week. The latest revision of DEoptim on R-Forge has the capability to evaluate the objective function on multiple cores using foreach.</description>

      <description>(This is a guest post by Ilya Kipnis)
When trading stocks in a single currency, instrument metadata can be safely ignored because the multiplier is 1 and the currencies are all the same. When doing analysis on fixed income products, options, futures, or other complex derivative instruments, the data defining the properties of these instruments becomes critical to tasks like accounting for value of trades, or comparing notional value between more than one instrument.</description>

Step 1: Get the data
The getSymbols function in quantmod makes this step easy if you can use daily data from Yahoo Finance. There are also &amp;ldquo;methods&amp;rdquo; (not in the strict sense) to pull data from other sources (FRED, Google, Oanda, R save files, databases, etc.</description>

      <description>This first post of the Backtesting in Excel and R series will provide some resources to help smooth the transition from the familiarity and comfort of Excel to the potentially strange and intimidating world of R.
I made my voyage from Excel to R more than 5 years ago and learned mostly by trial and error (and reading the R manuals). Most people don&amp;rsquo;t prefer my approach of &amp;ldquo;keep at it until you figure it out&amp;rdquo;, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of personal advice to share.</description>

      <description>I use R very frequently and take for granted much that it has to offer. I forget how R is different from similar tools, so I have trouble communicating the benefits of using R. The goal of this post is to highlight R&amp;rsquo;s main strengths, but first&amp;hellip; my story.

      <description>Before you start, note that there is now a Windows binary of RQuantLib is available on CRAN.

For those not familiar with IB, they offer a trading platform that excels on numerous fronts but is most appealing to those of us who trade algorithmically.</description>

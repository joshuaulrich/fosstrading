      <description>This is a long-overdue post. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get int the habit of posting and announcing each of my package releases. So I&amp;rsquo;m writing posts this morning for the most recent release of the most popular packages I maintain.
I released an updated version of xts to CRAN on 2020-09-09. I&amp;rsquo;m also going to include some notes from the prior release (0.12-0), since I didn&amp;rsquo;t post about that. It has some nifty changes in it too.</description>

      <description>This is another one of my long-overdue posts. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get int the habit of posting and announcing each of my package releases. So I&amp;rsquo;m writing posts this morning for the most recent release of the most popular packages I maintain.
I released an updated version of TTR to CRAN on 2020-09-01.
This is mainly a bug-fix release. There were several issues in the underlying C code that caused various issues.</description>

      <description>A new version of quantmod is on CRAN! One really cool thing about this release is that almost all the changes are contributions from the community.
Ethan Smith made more excellent contributions to getQuote() in this release. It no longer throws an error if one or more symbols are missing. And it handles multiple symbols in a semicolon-delimted string, just like getSymbols(). For example, you can get quotes for multiple symbols by calling getQuote(&amp;quot;SPY;AAPL&amp;quot;).</description>

      <description>I pushed an updated microbenchmark to CRAN a couple weeks ago. There were two noteworthy changes, thanks to great contributions from @MichaelChirico and @harvey131.
Michael fixed a bug in the check for whether the unit argument was a character string (#9, #10). The prior behavior was an uninformative error.
Harvey added a feature to allow you to use a string for common checks: &amp;ldquo;equal&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;identical&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;equivalent&amp;rdquo; (#16). So you don&amp;rsquo;t need to create a custom function to use all.</description>

      <description>I just pushed a new release of quantmod to CRAN! I&amp;rsquo;m most excited about the update to getSymbols() so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t throw an error and stop processing if there&amp;rsquo;s a problem with one ticker symbol. Now getSymbols() will import all the data it can, and provide an informative error message for any ticker symbols it could not import.
Another cool feature is that getQuote() can now import quotes from Tiingo. But don&amp;rsquo;t thank me; thank Ethan Smith for the feature request [#247] and pull request [#250].</description>

      <description>xts version 0.11-2 was published to CRAN yesterday. xts provides data structure and functions to work with time-indexed data. This is a bug-fix release, with notable changes below:
 The xts method for shift.time() is now registered. Thanks to Philippe Verspeelt for the report and PR (#268, #273). An if-statement in the xts constructor will no longer try to use a logical vector with length &amp;gt; 1. Code like if (c(TRUE, TRUE)) will throw a warning in an upcoming R release, and this patch will prevent that warning.</description>

      <description>xts version 0.11-1 was published to CRAN this morning. xts provides data structure and functions to work with time-indexed data. This release contains some awesome features that will transparently make your xts code even faster!
 There&amp;rsquo;s a new window.xts() method, thanks to Corwin Joy (#100, #240). Corwin also refactored and improved the performance of the binary search algorithm used to subset xts objects. Tom Andrews reported and fixed a few related regressions (#251, #263, #264).</description>

      <description>Someone recently shared this great talk by Chris Allen from lambda conf 2017. The title of the talk is &amp;ldquo;Why Johnny Can&amp;rsquo;t Code Good,&amp;rdquo; but the content is more about how to grow as a programmer. His points are true whether you&amp;rsquo;re just starting out, or have been coding for years.
My notes from Chris&amp;rsquo; talk are below, in the order they appear in the presentation. My thoughts are in parentheses.</description>

      <title>Goodbye Google, Hello Tiingo!</title>

      <guid>https://blog.fosstrading.com/2018/04/goodbye-google-hello-tiingo.html</guid>
      <description>First, the bad news:
Google Finance no longer provides data for historical prices or financial statements, so we say goodbye to getSymbols.google() and getFinancials.google(). (#221) They are now defunct as of quantmod 0.4-13.
Now, the good news:
Thanks to Steve Bronder, getSymbols() can now import data from Tiingo! (#220) This feature is part of quantmod 0.4-13, which is now on CRAN. Windows and Mac binaries should be built in a day or two.</description>

      <description>This xts release contains mostly bugfixes, but there are a few noteworthy features. Some of these features were added in version 0.10-1, but I forgot to blog about it. Anyway, in no particular order:
 endpoints() gained sub-second accuracy on Windows (#202)! na.locf.xts() now honors x and xout arguments by dispatching to the next method (#215). Thanks to Morten Grum for the report. na.locf.xts() and na.omit.xts() now support character xts objects.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to announce that the RQuantLib Windows binaries are now up to 0.4.4! The RQuantLib pre-built Windows binaries have been frozen on CRAN since 0.4.2, but now you can get version 0.4.4 binaries on Dirk&amp;rsquo;s ghrr drat repo.
Installation is as simple as:
drat::addRepo(&amp;#34;ghrr&amp;#34;) # maybe use &amp;#39;install.packages(&amp;#34;drat&amp;#34;)&amp;#39; first  install.packages(&amp;#34;RQuantLib&amp;#34;, type=&amp;#34;binary&amp;#34;) I will be able to create Windows binaries for future RQuantLib versions too, now that I have a Windows QuantLib build (version 1.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Paul Teetor, getSymbols() can now import data from Alpha Vantage! This feature is part of the quantmod 0.4-11 release, and provides another another data source to avoid any Yahoo Finance API changes*.
Alpha Vantage is a free web service that provides real-time and historical equity data. They provide daily, weekly, and monthly history for both domestic and international markets, with up to 20 years of history. Dividend and split adjusted close prices are available for daily data.</description>

      <description>A new, and long overdue, release of xts is now on CRAN! The major change is the completely new plot.xts() written by Michael Weylandt and Ross Bennett, and which is based on Jeff Ryan&amp;rsquo;s quantmod::chart_Series() code.
Do note that the new plot.xts() includes breaking changes to the original (and rather limited) plot.xts(). However, we believe the new functionality more than compensates for the potential one-time inconvenience. And I will no longer have to tell people that I use plot.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.fosstrading.com/2017/06/quantmod-0-4-9-on-cran.html</guid>
      <description>A new release of quantmod is now on CRAN! The only change was to address changes to Yahoo! Finance and their effects on getSymbols.yahoo(). GitHub issue #157 contains some details about the fix implementation.
Unfortunately, the URL wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only thing that changed. The actual data available for download changed as well.
The most noticeable difference is that the adjusted close column is no longer dividend-adjusted (i.e. it&amp;rsquo;s only split-adjusted). Also, only the close price is unadjusted; the open, high, and low are split-adjusted.</description>

      <description>I assume that you&amp;rsquo;re reading this because you are one of many people who were affected by the changes to Yahoo Finance data in May (2017). Not only did the URL change, but the actual data changed as well!
The most noticeable difference is that the adjusted close column is now only split-adjusted, whereas it used to be split- and dividend-adjusted. Another oddity is that only the close prices is unadjusted (strangely, the open, high, and low are split-adjusted).</description>

      <description>I pushed a bug-fix release of quantmod to CRAN last night. The major changes were to
 getSymbols.FRED() (#141) getSymbols.oanda() (#144) getSymbols.yahoo() (#149)  All three providers made breaking changes to their URLs/interfaces.
getSymbols.google() also got some love. It now honors all arguments set via setSymbolLookup() (#138), and it correctly parses the date column in non-English locales (#140).
There&amp;rsquo;s a handy new argument to getDividends(): split.adjust. It allows you to request dividends unadjusted for splits (#128).</description>

      <description>A quantmod user asked an interesting question on StackOverflow: Looping viewFinancials from quantmod. Basically, they wanted to create a data.frame that contained financial statement data for several companies for several years. I answered their question, and thought others might find the function I wrote useful&amp;hellip; hence, this post!
I called the function stackFinancials() because it would use getFinancials() and viewFinancials() to pull financial statement data for multiple symbols, and stack them together in long form.</description>

      <description>CRAN just accepted a bugfix release of quantmod. The most pertinent changes were to fix getSymbols.oanda (#36) and getOptionChain.yahoo (#92). It also includes a fix to addTRIX (#72).
Oanda changed their URL format from http to https, and getSymbols.oanda did not follow the redirect. Yahoo Finance changed the HTML for displaying options data, which broke getOptionChain.yahoo. The fix downloads JSON instead of scraping HTML, so hopefully it will be less likely to break.</description>

      <description>This post is in response to Michael Harris&amp;rsquo; Price Action Lab post, where he uses some simple R code to evaluate the asymmetry of returns from the day&amp;rsquo;s close to the following day&amp;rsquo;s open. I&amp;rsquo;d like to respond to his 3 notes, which I&amp;rsquo;ve included below.
  The R backtest assumes fractional shares. This means that equity is fully invested at each new position. This is important because it affects drawdown calculations.</description>

      <description>I just sent quantmod_0.4-5 to CRAN, and TTR_0.23-0 has been there for a couple weeks. I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank Ivan Popivanov for many useful reports and patches to TTR. He provided patches to add HMA() (Hull MA), ALMA(), and ultimateOscillator() functions.
James Toll provided a patch to the volatility() function that uses a zero mean (instead of the sample mean) in close-to-close volatility. The other big change is that moving average functions no longer return objects with column names based on the input object column names.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.fosstrading.com/2015/04/plotxts-rfc.html</guid>
      <description>We have been working on a new charting engine for xts::plot.xts for the past couple years. It started with Michael Weylandt&amp;rsquo;s work during the 2012 Google Summer of Code, and Ross Bennett took up the torch during the 2014 GSoC.
This new engine improves the functionality, modularity, and flexibility of plot.xts by building off the framework Jeff Ryan began with quantmod::chart_Series. The modular framework allows users to plot an xts object and incrementally build custom charts by adding panels of new data (including transformations of the original xts object).</description>

      <description>I pushed quantmod 0.4-4 to CRAN this weekend. It adds a getSymbols.yahooj function to pull stock data from Yahoo Finance Japan, and fixes issues in getOptionChain.yahoo and getSymbols.oanda.
Changes to the Yahoo Finance and Oanda websites broke the getOptionChain.yahoo and getSymbols.oanda functions, respectively. I didn&amp;rsquo;t use getOptionChain.yahoo much, so I’m not certain I restored all the prior functionality. Let me know if there’s something I missed. I’d be glad to add a test case for that, or to add a test you&amp;rsquo;ve written.</description>

      <description>The R Project has once again been selected as a mentoring organization for this year&amp;rsquo;s Google Summer of Code (GSoC). If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with GSoC, it&amp;rsquo;s a global program that offers students a stipend to write code for open source projects, under the direction of a mentor. Mentors get code written for their project, but no money. Students get something like a paid summer internship, with open-source contributions they can reference on their resume.</description>

      <description>An updated version of quantmod has just been released on CRAN. This is my first submission as the new maintainer. The major change was removing the dependency on the now-archived Defaults package. End-users shouldn&amp;rsquo;t notice a difference, since I basically copied the necessary functionality from Defaults and added it to quantmod.
There are also several bug fixes. A few worth noting are:

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been more than a month since R/Finance 2014, and my job has finally slowed down enough to allow me to write down my thoughts (though I&amp;rsquo;m writing this over two days during my train to and from Chicago).
The comments below are based on my personal experience. If I don&amp;rsquo;t comment on a seminar or presentation, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it or it wasn&amp;rsquo;t good; it may have been over my head or I may have been distracted with my duties as a committee member.</description>

      <description>The complaint I hear most frequently about quantstrat is that it&amp;rsquo;s slow, especially for large data. Some of this slow performance is due to quantstrat treating all strategies as path-dependent by default. Path dependence requires rules to be re-evaluated for each timestamp with a signal. More signals equates to longer run-times.
If your strategy is not path-dependent, you can get a fairly substantial performance improvement by turning path-dependence off. If your strategy truly is path-dependent, keep reading&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been one week since the 5th Annual R/Finance conference, and I finally feel sufficiently recovered enough to share my thoughts. The conference is a two-day whirlwind of applied quantitative finance, fantastic networking, and general geekery.

      <guid>https://blog.fosstrading.com/2013/03/ttr022-0-on-cran.html</guid>
      <description>An updated version of TTR is now on CRAN. The biggest changes to be aware of are that all moving averages attempt to set colnames, CCI() returns an object with colnames, and the initial gap for SAR() is not hard-coded at 0.01. There are also some much-needed bug fixes - most notably to Yang Zhang volatility, MACD(), SAR(), EMA()/EVWMA(), and adjRatios().
There are some exciting new features, including a rolling single-factor model function (rollSFM(), based on a prototype from James Toll), a runPercentRank() function from Charlie Friedemann, stoch() and WPR() return 0.</description>

      <description>The Google Summer of Code (2012) project to extend xts has produced a very promising new plot.xts function. Michael Weylandt, the project&amp;rsquo;s student, wrote R-SIG-Finance to request impressions, feedback, and bug reports. The function is housed in the xtsExtra package of the xts project on R-Forge.
Please try xtsExtra::plot.xts and let us know what you think. A sample of the eye-candy produced by the code in Michael&amp;rsquo;s email is below. Granted, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a one-liner, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly impressive!</description>

      <description>You have a problem: R is single-threaded, but your code would be faster if it could simultaneously run on more than one core. You have access to a cluster and/or your computer has multiple cores. Parallel R, by Q. Ethan McCallum and Stephen Weston, can help you put this extra computing power to use.
The book describes 6 approaches to distributed computing. Thoughts on each approach follow:

      <description>This post is a slightly revised (and &amp;ldquo;blogified&amp;rdquo;) version of the message Brian Peterson has sent to various R mailing lists.
Once again, R has been accepted as a mentoring organization for the Google Summer of Code (2012). We invite students interested in this program to learn more about it. A good starting point is the R GSoC wiki.
Students participating in the program receive US$5,000 for successful completion of a GSoC project, a great resume item, and an opportunity to work with R package authors.</description>

      <description>Running DEoptim in parallel has been on the development team&amp;rsquo;s wishlist for awhile. It had not been a priority though, because none of us have personally needed it. An opportunity arose when Kris Boudt approached me about collaborating to add this functionality as part of a consultancy project for a financial services firm.
We were able to add and test the functionality within a week. The latest revision of DEoptim on R-Forge has the capability to evaluate the objective function on multiple cores using foreach.</description>

      <description>An updated version of TTR is now on CRAN. It contains some much-needed bug fixes (most notably to stockSymbols()), some small changes, and a few new functions. Note that the change to wilderSum() will affect functions that use it (e.g. ADX()).
Here are the full contents of the CHANGES file:

      <description>As promised in the introduction to quantstrat, here is an example strategy. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d start with the obligatory tactical asset allocation (TAA) strategy. This post will replicate the strategy in the post, tactical asset allocation using blotter.
The &amp;ldquo;faber&amp;rdquo; demo in the quanstrat package contains a TAA strategy but it uses a slightly different approach than the code we&amp;rsquo;re trying to replicate. There are two major differences:
  The blotter TAA code initiates a position at the first observation where the close is above the SMA.</description>

      <description>quantstrat provides a generic infrastructure to model and backtest signal-based quantitative strategies. It is a high-level abstraction layer (built on xts, FinancialInstrument, blotter, etc.) that allows you to build and test strategies in very few lines of code. quantstrat is still under heavy development but is being used every day on real portfolios. We encourage you to send contributions and test cases to the project forums.

      <title>Creating Financial Instrument metadata in R</title>
      <link>https://blog.fosstrading.com/2011/07/creating-financial-instrument-metadata.html</link>

      <description>This is a guest post by Ilya Kipnis. He blogs at QuantStrat TradeR.
When trading stocks in a single currency, instrument metadata can be safely ignored because the multiplier is 1 and the currencies are all the same. When doing analysis on fixed income products, options, futures, or other complex derivative instruments, the data defining the properties of these instruments becomes critical to tasks like accounting for value of trades, or comparing notional value between more than one instrument.</description>

      <description>PRESS RELEASE
 The Leverage Space Portfolio (LSP) strategy seeks to maximize the probability of equity portfolio profitability by employing a risk-control process focused on capital preservation and drawdown management. Compared to a traditional buy-and-hold portfolio, an LSP-based portfolio aims for more consistent returns with lower risk.
The indexes, scheduled to be launched in the second half of 2011, can serve as the basis of both passive and active investment funds, including exchange-traded funds, mutual funds, and institutional accounts, around the world.</description>

Step 1: Get the data
The getSymbols function in quantmod makes this step easy if you can use daily data from Yahoo Finance. There are also &amp;ldquo;methods&amp;rdquo; (not in the strict sense) to pull data from other sources (FRED, Google, Oanda, R save files, databases, etc.</description>

      <description>This first post of the Backtesting in Excel and R series will provide some resources to help smooth the transition from the familiarity and comfort of Excel to the potentially strange and intimidating world of R.
I made my voyage from Excel to R more than 5 years ago and learned mostly by trial and error (and reading the R manuals). Most people don&amp;rsquo;t prefer my approach of &amp;ldquo;keep at it until you figure it out&amp;rdquo;, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of personal advice to share.</description>

 Due to a change in how R-2.12.0 is built, CRAN maintainers could no longer provide a Windows binary of RQuantLib with the QuantLib library they had been using. I decided to try and build an updated QuantLib library from source, which would allow me (and them) to build the current RQuantLib.

      <guid>https://blog.fosstrading.com/2010/08/margin-constraints-with-lspm.html</guid>
      <description>When optimizing leverage space portfolios, I frequently run into the issue of one or more f$ ([Max Loss]/f) being less than the margin of its respective instrument. For example, assume the required margin for an instrument is $500, f$ is $100, and $100,000 in equity. The optimal amount to trade is 1,000 shares ($100,000/$100). However, that would require $500,000 in equity, while you only have $100,000. What do you do?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve shown several examples of how to use LSPM&amp;rsquo;s probDrawdown() function as a constraint when optimizing a leverage space portfolio. Those posts implicitly assume the probDrawdown() function produces an accurate estimate of actual drawdown. This post will investigate the function&amp;rsquo;s accuracy.
Calculation Notes:
To calculate the probability of drawdown, the function traverses all permutations of the events in your lsp object over the given horizon and sums the probability of each permutation that hits the drawdown constraint.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll start by highlighting that while all the software in this post is indeed free (true to FOSS), an account with Interactive Brokers is needed to make use of it. For those not familiar with IB, they offer a trading platform that excels on numerous fronts but is most appealing to those of us who trade algorithmically.</description>

      <description>Michael Stokes, author of the MarketSci blog recently published a thought-provoking post about the correlation between historical and future volatility (measured as the standard deviation of daily close price percentage changes). This post is intended as an extension of his &amp;ldquo;unfinished thought&amp;rdquo;, not a critique.
He suggests using his table of volatility correlations as a back-of-the-envelope approach to estimate future volatility, which led me to question the stability of the correlations in his table.</description>

      <description>To continue with the LSPM examples, this post shows how to optimize a Leverage Space Portfolio for the maximum probability of profit. The data and example are again taken from The Leverage Space Trading Model by Ralph Vince.
These optimizations take a very long time. 100 iterations on a 10-core Amazon EC2 cluster took 21 hours. Again, the results will not necessarily match the book because of differences between DEoptim and Ralph&amp;rsquo;s genetic algorithm and because there are multiple possible paths one can take through leverage space that will achieve similar results.</description>

 R / Finance 2010: Applied Finance with R
April 16 &amp;amp; 17, Chicago, IL, US
The second annual R / Finance conference for applied finance using R, the premier free software system for statistical computation and graphics, will be held this spring in Chicago, IL, USA on Friday April 16 and Saturday April 17.
Building on the success of the inaugural R / Finance 2009 event, this two-day conference will cover topics as diverse as portfolio theory, time-series analysis, as well as advanced risk tools, high-performance computing, and econometrics.</description>

      <title>LSPM with snow</title>

      <guid>https://blog.fosstrading.com/2010/01/lspm-with-snow.html</guid>
      <description>My last post provided examples of how to use the LSPM package. Those who experimented with the code have probably found that constrained optimizations with horizon &amp;gt; 6 have long run-times (when calc.max &amp;gt;= horizon).
This post will illustrate how the snow package can increase the speed of the probDrawdown() and probRuin() functions on computers with multiple cores. This yields nearly linear improvements in run-times relative to the number of cores.</description>

      <description>I have received several requests for additional LSPM documentation over the past couple days and a couple months ago I promised an introduction to LSPM.
In this long-overdue post, I will show how to optimize a Leverage Space Portfolio with the LSPM package. Please use the comments to let me know what you would like to see next.
Some copious notes before we get to the code:
These examples are based on revision 26 31 from r-forge and will not work under earlier revisions (and may not work with later revisions).</description>

      <guid>https://blog.fosstrading.com/2009/11/tactical-asset-allocation-using-blotter.html</guid>
      <description>NOTE: If you simply want to test strategies in R, please see the post: Tactical Asset Allocation Using quantstrat. quantstrat uses blotter behind the scenes, but provides a higher level of abstraction.
blotter is an R package that tracks the P&amp;amp;L of your trading systems (or simulations), even if your portfolio spans many security types and/or currencies. This post uses blotter to track a simple two-ETF trading system.
The contents of this post borrow heavily from code and comments in the &amp;ldquo;longtrend&amp;rdquo; demo script in the blotter package.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick R implementation of David Varadi&amp;rsquo;s alternative to the RSI(2). Michael Stokes over at the MarketSci blog has three great posts exploring this indicator:
 Varadi&amp;rsquo;s RSI(2) Alternative: The DV(2) RSI(2) vs. DV(2) Last Couple of Notes on DV(2)  Here&amp;rsquo;s the R code:
DV &amp;lt;- function(HLC, n=2, bounded=FALSE) { # &amp;#34;HLC&amp;#34; is an _xts_ object with &amp;#34;High&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Low&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Close&amp;#34;  # columns, in that order.  # This is David Varadi&amp;#39;s alternative to the RSI(2).</description>

      <description>This post continues the series of investigating the RSI(2) strategy. The first post replicated this simple RSI(2) strategy from the MarketSci Blog using R. The second post showed how to replicate the strategy that scales in/out of RSI(2).
If you like the RSI(2), be sure to check out David Varadi&amp;rsquo;s RSI(2) alternative!
This post will use the PerformanceAnalytics package to evaluate the rules that scale in/out of positions. I&amp;rsquo;ve also provided a simple function that provides some summary statistics.</description>

      <description>quantmod, TTR, and xts were (not so) recently featured on the Inference for R Blog. Inference for R is a Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed specifically for R.
The post gives an example of how to easily perform advanced financial stock analysis using Inference in Excel.
I appreciate how they&amp;rsquo;re making R more accessible to a general audience, even though I like a command line interface and my preferred development environment is vim.</description>

      <description>The first international R/Finance 2009 conference in Chicago, IL was a huge success! David Smith from REvolution Computing has written a great summary of the entire event. I&amp;rsquo;ll take the lazy route and point you to his blog post. :)
 The first international conference dedicated to the use of R in the finance industry, R/Finance 2009, was a great success. With over 150 attendees (my poor estimation skills notwithstanding), sold-out tutorials, and an outstanding lineup of invited and contributing speakers from around the world, this event really demonstrated the importance of R in the world of financial analysis.</description>

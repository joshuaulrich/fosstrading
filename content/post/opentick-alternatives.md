I've been getting a bit of traffic from people searching for opentick [(the defunct company)](http://blog.fosstrading.com/2009/04/opentick-is-no-more.html), so I've started a list of similar (but non-free) data providers.  
  
I'm not affiliated with any of these vendors, and the list is in no particular order. I'll update this post as more information becomes available.

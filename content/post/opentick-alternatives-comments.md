I just started looking into getting data again and found opentick is gone :(  
Thanks for this post!

You're most welcome. Let me know if you find anything that should be included in the list.

Fried,  
  
Thanks for the link. I found that page as well, but didn't include any of those vendors because they appear _very_ expensive. Therefore, not really substitutes for opentick.  
  
As stated on that page, QuantHouse is ~$6,000 / month; Digital Data Feed is about half that. I'll try to find prices for the other vendors and I'll add them to the list if they aren't too expensive.

Thanks for the post. As a student all of these feeds seem a bit expensive. Are there any alternatives for doing non-commercial research? I am mostly interested in visualization of live data at the moment. I was thinking of using Google data apis. Thoughts?

Hi dan,  
  
Universities sometimes have access to data for research purposes, so I'd check with your school first.  
  
Some brokerages provide access to data if you have an account with them ([Interactive Brokers](http://www.interactivebrokers.com/ibg/main.php), [Lime](http://www.limebrokerage.com/index.php?title=Lime_Brokerage_LLC), etc.).  
  
I don't know anything about the Google Data APIs, but it looks like [quantmod](http://www.quantmod.com/) can do what their Financial API does...

You can check CQG API too. Its not too cheap, but not terribly expensive. Depends on how many exchanges to listen.

Quotetracker's website has a page devoted to enumerating data sources: http://quotetracker.com/qsources.shtml Some are inexpensive and APIs are available for small fees as well, e.g. Marketfeed

I'd like to add to your list:  
\- www.tickdata.com  
\- www.cqgdatafactory.com (another post mentions 'cqg', sry if we're referring to the same thing); about cqg I can say that I've asked their support team a question a few days ago and got absolutely nothing in reply.

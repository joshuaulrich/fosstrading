[![](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/images/gsoc2015-300x270.jpg)](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/images/gsoc2015-300x270.jpg)The R Project has once again been selected as a [mentoring organization](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2015/wiki/Admin_Application) for this year's [Google Summer of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015) (GSoC).  If you're not familiar with GSoC, it's a global program that offers students a stipend to write code for open source projects, under the direction of a mentor.  Mentors get code written for their project, but no money.  Students get something like a paid summer internship, with open-source contributions they can reference on their resume.  
  
If you’re interested in participating as a student or a mentor, there's an overview of the GSoC program on [The R Project GSoC 2015 Wiki](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2015/wiki).  The wiki also includes a timeline and links to prior year's projects.  
  
Several mentors from various backgrounds have already [proposed projects](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2015/wiki/table%20of%20proposed%20coding%20projects) for students to work on this summer.  Mentors have until March 9th to submit projects they would be willing to support, and student applications begin on March 16th.

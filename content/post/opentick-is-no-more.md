After a year of "we plan to accept new subscribers shortly", [opentick](http://www.opentick.com/) has shut its doors completely. As of March 20th, the opentick service is no longer available.  
  
From [opentick.com](http://www.opentick.com/):  
  

> 3/16/2009  
>   
> To opentick subscribers, friends, supporters, contributors and the rest of the community...  
>   
> It has been quite a journey for opentick, and for those of you who have been with us for the ride we cannot thank you enough for the support, contributions and guidance you have given us over the course of the last 5 years. We could not have come as far as we have without you.  
>   
> However, we are sad to say that the time has come for us to close the doors for opentick. However, this isn't goodbye. In fact, it's a new beginning. We will be introducing a fresh service with all the bells and whistles we've been slaving on over the course of the last year under a new name, a new website and a new level of service. Check back here in the near future for more information about the forthcoming new company and service. Of course amongst all these changes, there are some things that will remain the same - we still aim to provide a reliable free market data service, with an open architecture for a wide range of software platform support.  
>   
> If you are a current paying subscriber, this March billing cycle will be your final billing cycle; at your next billing date service will be terminated. If you are a delayed or historical data user not currently paying for service, your account will be deactivated as of Friday, March 20th.  
>   
> Sincerely,  
> opentick Staff  
>   
> One day, we shall come back. Yes, we shall come back. Until then, there must be no regrets, no tears, no anxieties. Just go forward in all your beliefs, and prove to us we are not mistaken in ours.

  
I'm not optimistic their new offering (most likely their sister company, [Xasax](http://www.xasax.com/)) will be available anytime soon. The managers of the two companies sub-optimally managed expectations with opentick and potential Xasax customers are sure to keep that in mind.  
  
At least I learned quite a bit creating the 'opentick' package, since it is now useless... perhaps Xasax will have a similar API, but I won't get my hopes up.

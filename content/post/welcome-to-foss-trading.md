This blog will highlight the development and use of free open-source software to research, test, and trade financial markets.  
  
Meet the authors:  
  
Joshua Ulrich is currently the author and maintainer of four R packages:

*   [**TTR**](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TTR/index.html) - Technical Trading Rules - a suite of technical analysis functions  
    
*   [**opentick**](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/opentick/index.html) - an R API to the opentick databases  
    
*   [**xts**](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/index.html) - eXtensible Time Series - a time-based data class that integrates all of the current time-series classes (co-authored with Jeff Ryan)  
    
*   [**pack**](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pack/index.html) - convert binary to and from formats other programs and machines can understand

Jeff Ryan is currently the author and maintainer of four R packages:  

*   [**quantmod**](http://www.quantmod.com/) - specify, build, trade, and analyse quantitative financial trading strategies
*   [**IBrokers**](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/IBrokers/index.html) - provides native R access to Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation API
*   [**xts**](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/index.html) - eXtensible Time Series - a time-based data class that integrates all of the current time-series classes (co-authored with Joshua Ulrich)
*   [Defaults](http://cran.wustl.edu/web/packages/Defaults/index.html) - create global function defaults

As you may have guessed, most of the software we develop is in the R language/environment, but we also write code in C and Fortran for efficiency. There are several reasons we use R:  

*   R allows for rapid prototyping, since it is a scripted language.  
    
*   The list of [finance-oriented R packages](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Finance.html) is large and growing.  
    
*   The [R-Finance community](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-finance) continues to grow rapidly.  
    
*   A multitude of statistical routines are available in [contributed packages](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/).  
    

We hope, with your help, this blog advances the use of free open source software in the finance / trading community!

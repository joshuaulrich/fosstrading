[Timely Portfolio](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/) has been doing some interesting work with [Ralph Vince's](http://www.ralphvince.com/) [Leverage Space Model](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470455950?ie=UTF8&tag=fosstrading-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0470455950) via the [LSPM](http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/lspm) [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package.

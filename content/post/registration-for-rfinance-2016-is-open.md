You can find [registration information](http://www.rinfinance.com/register/) and [agenda details](http://www.rinfinance.com/agenda/) on the conference website.  Or you can go directly to the [Cvent registration page](http://go.uic.edu/rfinance).  
  
Note that registration fees _**will increase by 50%**_ at the end of early registration on May 6, 2016.  
  
The conference will take place on May 20 and 21, at [UIC](http://www.uic.edu/) in Chicago.  Building on the success of the previous conferences in 2009-2015, we expect more than 250 attendees from around the world. R users from industry, academia, and government will joining 50 presenters covering all areas of finance with R.  
  
We are very excited about the four keynote presentations given by [Patrick Burns](http://www.burns-stat.com/), [Frank Diebold](http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/~fdiebold/), [Tarek Eldin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarekeldin), and [Rishi Narang](http://www.thequantbook.com/about-the-author.html).  The conference agenda (currently) includes 17 full presentations and 33 shorter "lightning talks".  As in previous years, several (optional) pre-conference seminars are offered on Friday morning.  
  
There is also an (optional) conference dinner at The Riverside Room and Gallery at Trump.  Situated directly on the hotel's new River Walk, it is a perfect venue to continue conversations while dining and drinking.

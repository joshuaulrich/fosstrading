R/Finance 2017: Applied Finance with R

May 19 and 20, 2017

University of Illinois at Chicago

  

The ninth annual R/Finance conference for applied finance using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) will be held on May 19 and 20, 2017 in Chicago, IL, USA at the [University of Illinois at Chicago](http://www.uic.edu/).  The conference will cover topics including portfolio management, time series analysis, advanced risk tools, high-performance computing, market microstructure, and econometrics.  All will be discussed within the context of using R as a primary tool for financial risk management, portfolio construction, and trading.

  

Over the past eight years, R/Finance has included attendees from around the world.  It has featured presentations from prominent academics and practitioners, and we anticipate another exciting line-up for 2017.

  

We invite you to submit complete papers in pdf format for consideration.  We will also consider one-page abstracts (in txt or pdf format) although more complete papers are preferred.  We welcome submissions for both full talks and abbreviated "lightning talks." Both academic and practitioner proposals related to R are encouraged.

  

All slides will be made publicly available at conference time.  Presenters are strongly encouraged to provide working R code to accompany the slides.  Data sets should also be made public for the purposes of reproducibility (though we realize this may be limited due to contracts with data vendors).  Preference may be given to presenters who have released R packages.

  

Financial assistance for travel and accommodation may be available to presenters, however requests must be made at the time of submission.  Assistance will be granted at the discretion of the conference committee.

  

Please submit proposals online at [http://go.uic.edu/rfinsubmit](https://goo.gl/vMweMX).  Submissions will be reviewed and accepted on a rolling basis with a final deadline of February 28, 2017.  Submitters will be notified via email by March 31, 2017 of acceptance, presentation length, and financial assistance (if requested).

  

Additional details will be announced via the conference website [www.RinFinance.com](http://www.rinfinance.com/) as they become available.  Information on previous years' presenters and their presentations are also at the conference website.  We will make a separate announcement when registration opens.

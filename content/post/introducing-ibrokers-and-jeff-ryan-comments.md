Thanks for the mention of the trading-shim, Jeff -- For those who do not know Jeff from the 'R' SIG for finance, I would also commend his fine work there. See: https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-finance

Jeff,  
  
Great article. I used it to set up and test my IB link.  
  
Your last sentence in the article was:  
  
  
".....Next time we'll explore the real-time data features of IBrokers, including live market data, real-time bars, and order-book data capabilities....."  
  
  
Have you had a chance to write up these features? I am very interested in real time trading methods.  
  
  
Thanks,  
Bill

Does anyone have a full working example of iBrokers using real-time data and trade execution?

[quantmod](http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/quantmod/), [TTR](http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/ttr/), and [xts](http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/xts/) were (not so) recently featured on the [Inference for R Blog](http://inferenceforr.com/blog/default.aspx). [Inference for R](http://inferenceforr.com/default.aspx) is a Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed specifically for [R](http://www.r-project.org/).  
  
[The post](http://inferenceforr.com/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=17) gives an example of how to easily perform advanced financial stock analysis using Inference in Excel.  
  
I appreciate how they're making [R](http://www.r-project.org/) more accessible to a general audience, even though I like a command line interface and my preferred development environment is [vim](http://www.vim.org). :-)

R/Finance 2018: Applied Finance with R

June 1 and 2, 2018

University of Illinois at Chicago

  

**Call For Papers**

  

The tenth annual R/Finance conference for applied finance using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) will be held June 1 and 2, 2018 in Chicago, IL, USA at the [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.uic.edu/). The conference will cover topics including portfolio management, time series analysis, advanced risk tools, high-performance computing, market microstructure, and econometrics. All will be discussed within the context of using R as a primary tool for financial risk management, portfolio construction, and trading.

  

Over the past nine years, R/Finance has included attendees from around the world. It has featured presentations from prominent academics and practitioners, and we anticipate another exciting line-up for 2018.

  

We invite you to submit complete papers in pdf format for consideration. We will also consider one-page abstracts (in txt or pdf format) although more complete papers are preferred. We welcome submissions for both full talks and abbreviated lightning talks. Both academic and practitioner proposals related to R are encouraged.

  

All slides will be made publicly available at conference time. Presenters are strongly encouraged to provide working R code to accompany the slides. Data sets should also be made public for the purposes of reproducibility (though we realize this may be limited due to contracts with data vendors). Preference may be given to presenters who have released R packages.

  

Please submit proposals online at [http://go.uic.edu/rfinsubmit](http://go.uic.edu/rfinsubmit)[](https://www.blogger.com/). Submissions will be reviewed and accepted on a rolling basis with a final submission deadline of February 2, 2018. Submitters will be notified via email by March 2, 2018 of acceptance, presentation length, and financial assistance (if requested).

  

Financial assistance for travel and accommodation may be available to presenters. Requests for financial assistance do not affect acceptance decisions. Requests should be made at the time of submission. Requests made after submission are much less likely to be fulfilled. Assistance will be granted at the discretion of the conference committee.

  

Additional details will be announced via the [conference website](http://www.rinfinance.com/) as they become available. Information on previous years' presenters and their presentations are also at the conference website. We will make a separate announcement when registration opens.

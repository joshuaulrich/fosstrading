Hi Joshua,  
  
Thanks for excellent advice. 'Keep at it till you figure it out'. Indeed.  
  
It would be great if you could offer your thoughts on how to move to next stage of R viz. building packages. How and when did you make that transition? What are the good resources, sites, tools toward that?  
  
Thanks a lot,  
Ravi

Some notes:  
  
1) Deducer is also an interesting GUI to mention.  
  
2)There is an integration between RExcel and R commander.  
  
3) RStudio is not a GUI it's an IDE (a great one, one which I have faith that will grow wonderfully), but it's not a GUI  
  
4) I recently wrote a book review about "25 recipes for getting started with R"  
http://www.r-statistics.com/2011/02/book-review-25-recipes-for-getting-started-with-r/  
I think it's a good starter book.  
  
(p.s: If we are into general links, it might be in place to mention: www.R-bloggers.com :) )  
  
Cheers,  
Tal

Don't forget to mention RKWard for GUI's:  
  
http://rkward.sourceforge.net/  
  
For Linux users almost every distribution has packaged it in their repos, for Windows users there are guides @ their wiki, e.g. for Windows users: http://bit.ly/

Hi Ravi,  
  
I'll keep that in mind for future posts.  
  
Tal,  
  
Thanks for the excellent points!  
  
moondowner,  
  
I didn't mention RKWard because of the "known issues" on Windows, since most Excel users only use Windows.

Thanks for the list. RStudio is fantastic and exactly what I've been needing! All in one place, you can view the objects, the procedure you're working with, the output window, all the plotted items, the directory, all your packages, the R Help page, etc. I've always loved R but this changes everything!

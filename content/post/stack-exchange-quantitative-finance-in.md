The [Quantitative Finance](http://quant.stackexchange.com/) [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) community entered public beta last week.  To quote the [FAQ](http://quant.stackexchange.com/faq):  

> The Quantitative Finance Stack Exchange is intended specifically for professionals and traders working in investment banking, and academics involved in teaching and research.

> Topics include pricing of securities, derivatives, options, risk modeling, quantitative techniques, and the mathematics used in quantitative finance.

Several members of the R/Finance community are active there too.  Some names you may recognize: [Patrick Burns](http://www.burns-stat.com/), [Shane](http://www.statalgo.com/), [Dirk Eddelbuettel](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/), [Jeff Ryan](http://www.lemnica.com/), and [Paul Teetor](http://quanttrader.info/public/).

I can't believe it's been two months since I last posted... wow, time has a way of slipping through my fingers.Â  Here's a short list of some upcoming posts:  

*   An introduction to [LSPM](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/lspm) -- a new R package that implements [Ralph Vince's](http://parametricplanet.com/rvince/) leverage space portfolio model (co-authored with [Soren Macbeth](http://dopeness.org/)).
*   Updated charting with [quantmod](http://www.quantmod.com/).
*   An introduction to [blotter](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/blotter) -- a transaction-based infrastructure for trading systems and simulation, providing support for multi-asset class and multi-currency portfolios.

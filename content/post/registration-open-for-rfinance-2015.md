You can find [registration information](http://www.rinfinance.com/register/) and [agenda details](http://www.rinfinance.com/agenda/) (as they become available) on the conference website.  Or you can go [directly to the registration page](http://www.cvent.com/d/94q27k).  Note that there's an early-bird registration deadline of May 15.  
  
The conference will take place on May 29 and 30, at [UIC](http://www.uic.edu/) in Chicago.  Building on the success of the previous conferences in 2009-2014, we expect more than 250 attendees from around the world. R users from industry, academia, and government will joining 30+ presenters covering all areas of finance with R.  
  
We are very excited about the four keynote presentations given by [Emanuel Derman](http://www.emanuelderman.com/info/about), [Louis Marascio](http://fitnr.com/about-louis-marascio.html), [Alexander McNeil](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~mcneil/), and [Rishi Narang](http://www.thequantbook.com/about-the-author.html).  The main agenda (currently) includes 18 full presentations and 19 shorter "lightning talks".  As in previous years, several (optional) pre-conference seminars are offered on Friday morning.  
  
There is also an (optional) conference dinner that will once-again be held at [The Terrace at Trump](http://www.trumphotelcollection.com/chicago/rooftop-restaurants-chicago.php) Hotel. Overlooking the Chicago river and skyline, it is a perfect venue to continue conversations while dining and drinking.

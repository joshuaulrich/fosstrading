This year marks the 10th anniversary of the R/Finance Conference!  As in prior years, we expect more than 250 attendees from around the world. R users from industry, academia, and government will joining 50+ presenters covering all areas of finance with R.  The conference will take place on June 1st and 2nd, at [UIC](http://www.uic.edu/) in Chicago.  
  
You can find [registration information](http://www.rinfinance.com/#registration)on the conference website, or you can go directly to the [Cvent registration page](http://go.uic.edu/rfinance).  
  
Note that registration fees _**will increase by 50%**_ at the end of early registration on May 21, 2018.  
  
We are very excited about keynote presentations by [JJ Allaire](https://github.com/jjallaire), [Li Deng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lideng), and [Norm Matloff](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/matloff/).  The conference agenda (currently) includes 18 full presentations and 33 shorter "lightning talks".  As in previous years, several (optional) pre-conference seminars are offered on Friday morning.  We're still working on the agenda, but we have another great lineup of speakers this year!  
  
There is also an (optional) conference dinner at Wyndham Grand Chicago Riverfront in the 39th Floor Penthouse Ballroom and Terrace.  Situated directly on the riverfront, it is a perfect venue to continue conversations while dining and drinking.

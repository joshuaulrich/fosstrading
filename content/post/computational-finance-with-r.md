Krishna Kumar, Jan Vecer and the great folks at [REvolution computing](http://www.revolution-computing.com/) put on [a great event](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/pages/ComputationalFinance/index.html) at the beautiful [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/) campus on the Upper West Side of New York.  
  
Presentations by Whit Armstrong, Anthony Brockwell, Bryan Lewis, Scott Payseur, Peter Carl, Brian Peterson, and our own Jeff Ryan made for an impressive display of the power of R in quant finance. Jeff's presentation slides can be found [here](http://www.quantmod.com/Columbia2008).  
  
Some great things are happening in this community, and we are certainly glad to be part of them.

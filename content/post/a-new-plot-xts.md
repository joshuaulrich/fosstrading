The [Google Summer of Code (2012)](http://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012) project to [extend xts](http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php?id=developers:projects:gsoc2012:xts) has produced a very promising new plot.xts function.  Michael Weylandt, the project's student, wrote [R-SIG-Finance](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-finance) to [request impressions, feedback, and bug reports](http://draft.blogger.com/%20https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-finance/2012q3/010652.html).  The function is housed in the [xtsExtra](https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/pkg/xtsExtra/?root=xts) package of the [xts project on R-Forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/xts).  
  
Please try xtsExtra::plot.xts and let us know what you think.  A sample of the eye-candy produced by the code in [Michael's email](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-finance/2012q3/010652.html) is below.  Granted, this isn't a one-liner, but it's certainly impressive!  Great work Michael!

If you haven't signed up for the [Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics](https://www.coursera.org/course/compfinance) course taught by [Eric Zivot](http://faculty.washington.edu/ezivot/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), it's not too late. Â The second week just started and the first assignments aren't due until September 18th.  
  
Join me in getting a good refresher on basic statistics, simulation and bootstrapping, linear algebra, and learning more about portfolio optimization, efficient portfolios, and risk budgeting.

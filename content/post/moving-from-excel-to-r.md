This first post of the [Backtesting in Excel and R](http://blog.fosstrading.com/2011/02/backtesting-in-excel-and-r.html) series will provide some resources to help smooth the transition from the familiarity and comfort of Excel to the potentially strange and intimidating world of [R](http://www.r-project.org/).  
  
I made my voyage from Excel to R more than 5 years ago and learned mostly by trial and error (and reading the R manuals).  Most people don't prefer my approach of "keep at it until you figure it out", so I don't have a lot of personal advice to share.  My main piece of advice is that the best way to learn R is to use it, so most of the resources below focus on "how-to" do certain things in R.  
  
**GUIs**  
  
While R for Windows comes with a very basic GUI (I'm not familiar with the R for Mac OS X GUIs), most people will want and benefit from something more elaborate.  The GUIs below were taken from the [R GUI Projects page](http://www.sciviews.org/_rgui/) (visit the page for more information / alternatives) and I added the newcomer, RStudio:  

*   [R Commander](http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/)
*   [Tinn-R](http://www.sciviews.org/SciViews-R/index.html%3ESciViews-R%3C/a%3E%3C/li%3E%0A%3Cli%3E%3Ca%20href=)
*   [JGR](http://jgr.markushelbig.org/)
*   [StatET](http://www.walware.de/goto/statet)
*   [Red-R](http://www.red-r.org/)
*   [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org/)

**Blogs / Videos**  

*   The [Climate Charts & Graphs blog](http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/) has a [video](http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/2009/02/27/video-to-help-excel-users-get-familiar-with-r/) to help help Excel users get familiar with R, a [list of R resources](http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/r-resources/), and--most impressive of all--a [toolkit to help Excel users move up to R](http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/learnr-toolkit/).
*   The [Decision Science News](http://www.decisionsciencenews.com/) blog has two video tutorials ([part 1](http://www.decisionsciencenews.com/2007/09/26/r-video-tutorial-number-1/), [part 2](http://www.decisionsciencenews.com/2007/10/02/r-video-tutorial-number-2/)) to help people get started using R.
*   J.D. Long, a fellow economist, has compiled a [list of R resources](http://www.cerebralmastication.com/r-resources/) on his blog, [Cerebral Mastication](http://www.cerebralmastication.com/).

**Books**  
  
I haven't read these two books personally, but I've heard very good things about both of them.  Both focus on how to accomplish specific tasks with R.  

*   [R Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596809158?ie=UTF8&tag=fosstrading-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596809158)
*   [R in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/059680170X?ie=UTF8&tag=fosstrading-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=059680170X)

I hope this is helpful.  As always, please add suggestions in the comments!

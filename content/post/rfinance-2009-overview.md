The first international R/Finance 2009 conference in Chicago, IL was a huge success! David Smith from [REvolution Computing](http://www.revolution-computing.com/) has written [a great summary](http://blog.revolution-computing.com/2009/04/rfinance-2009-roundup.html) of the entire event. I'll take the lazy route and point you to his blog post. :)  

> The first international conference dedicated to the use of R in the finance industry, [R/Finance 2009](http://www.rinfinance.com/), was a great success. With over 150 attendees (my poor [estimation](http://twitter.com/revodavid/status/1606990522) skills notwithstanding), sold-out tutorials, and an outstanding lineup of invited and contributing speakers from around the world, this event really demonstrated the importance of [R in the world of financial analysis](http://www.revolution-computing.com/industry/finance.php).

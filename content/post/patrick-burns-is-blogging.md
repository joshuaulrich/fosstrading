[Patrick Burns](http://www.burns-stat.com/) is the author of several helpful [R](http://www.r-project.org/) resources, including [A Guide for the Unwilling S User](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/unwilling_S.pdf), [The R Inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf), and [S Poetry](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/spoetry.html). He also wrote one of my favorite critiques of Microsoft Excel: [Spreadsheet Addiction](http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/spreadsheet_addiction.html).  
  
His writing is witty, entertaining, and packed fully of useful bits of information.Â  I strongly recommend you add [his blog](http://www.portfolioprobe.com/blog) to your list of regular reading material.

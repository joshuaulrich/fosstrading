You can find more information on the [R/Finance conference website](http://www.rinfinance.com/).  Hope to see you in Chicago in May!  
  
  
The registration for R/Finance 2012 -- which will take place May 11 and 12 in Chicago -- is NOW OPEN!  
  
Building on the success of the three previous conferences in 2009, 2010, and 2011, we expect more than 250 attendees from around the world.  R users from industry, academia, and government will join 40+ presenters covering all areas of finance with R.  
  
This year's conference will start earlier in the day on Friday, to accommodate the tremendous line up of speakers for 2012, as well as to provide more time between talks for networking.  
  
We are very excited about the four keynotes by [Paul Gilbert](http://tsdbi.r-forge.r-project.org/), [Blair Hull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blair_Hull), [Rob McCulloch](http://www.rob-mcculloch.org/), and [Simon Urbanek](http://simon.urbanek.info/).  The main agenda includes nineteen full presentations and eighteen shorter "lightning talks".  We are also excited to offer six optional pre-conference seminars on Friday morning.  
  
Once again, we are hosting the R/Finance conference dinner on Friday evening, where you can continue conversations while dining and drinking atop a West Loop restaurant overlooking the Chicago skyline.

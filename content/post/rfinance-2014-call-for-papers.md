We're getting ready for this year's R/Finance conference.  Here's the call for papers.  I hope to see you there!  
  
R/Finance 2014: Applied Finance with R  
May 16 and 17, 2014  
University of Illinois at Chicago  
  
The sixth annual R/Finance conference for applied finance using [R](http://draft.blogger.com/) will be held on May 16 and 17, 2014 in Chicago, IL, USA at the [University of Illinois at Chicago](http://www.uic.edu/).  The conference will cover topics including portfolio management, time series analysis, advanced risk tools, high-performance computing, market microstructure, and econometrics. All will be discussed within the context of using R as a primary tool for financial risk management, portfolio construction, and trading.  
  
Over the past five years, R/Finance has included attendees from around the world. It has featured presentations from prominent academics and practitioners, and we anticipate another exciting line-up for 2014.  
  
We invite you to submit complete papers in pdf format for consideration. We will also consider one-page abstracts (in txt or pdf format), although more complete papers are preferred.  We welcome submissions for both full talks and abbreviated "lightning talks".  Both academic and practitioner proposals related to R are encouraged.  
  
Presenters are strongly encouraged to provide working R code to accompany the presentation/paper.  Data sets should also be made public for the purposes of reproducibility (though we realize this may be limited due to contracts with data vendors). Preference may be given to presenters who have released R packages.  
  
The conference will award two (or more) $1000 prizes for best papers.  A submission must be a full paper to be eligible for a best paper award. Extended abstracts, even if a full paper is provided by conference time, are not eligible for a best paper award.  Financial assistance for travel and accommodation may be available to presenters at the discretion of the conference committee. Requests for assistance should be made at the time of submission.  
  
Please submit your papers or abstracts online at: [goo.gl/OmKnu7](http://goo.gl/OmKnu7).  The submission deadline is January 31, 2014.  Submitters will be notified via email by February 28, 2014 of acceptance, presentation length, and decisions on requested funding.  
  
Additional details will be announced via the conference website [www.RinFinance.com](http://www.rinfinance.com/) as they become available. Information on previous years' presenters and their presentations are also at the conference website.

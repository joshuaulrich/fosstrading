The registration for R/Finance 2013 -- which will take place May 17 and 18 in Chicago -- is NOW OPEN!  
  
Building on the success of the previous conferences in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, we expect more than 250 attendees from around the world. R users from industry, academia, and government will joining 30+ presenters covering all areas of finance with R.  
  
We are very excited about the four keynotes by [Sanjiv Das](http://www.scu.edu/business/finance/faculty/das.cfm), [Attilio Meucci](http://www.symmys.com/attilio-meucci), [Ryan Sheftel](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ryansheftel), and [Ruey Tsay](http://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/t/ruey-s-tsay). The main agenda (currently) includes seventeen full presentations and fifteen shorter "lightning talks". We are also excited to offer five optional pre-conference seminars on Friday morning.  
  
To celebrate the fifth year of the conference in style, the dinner will be held at [The Terrace at Trump](http://www.trumphotelcollection.com/chicago/rooftop-restaurants-chicago.php) Hotel. Overlooking the Chicago river and skyline, it is a perfect venue to continue conversations while dining and drinking.

As announced on the [R-SIG-Finance](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-finance/2014q1/012330.html) mailing list, registration for R/Finance 2014 is **now open**! The conference will take place May 17 and 18 in Chicago.  
  
Building on the success of the previous conferences in 2009-2013, we expect more than 250 attendees from around the world. R users from industry, academia, and government will joining 30+ presenters covering all areas of finance with R.  
  
We are very excited about the four keynote presentations given by [Bob McDonald](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/mcdonald_robert.aspx), [Bill Cleveland](http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wsc/), [Alexios Ghalanos](http://www.unstarched.net/about/), and [Luke Tierney](http://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/). The main agenda (currently) includes 16 full presentations and 21 shorter "lightning talks". We are also excited to offer four optional pre-conference seminars on Friday morning.  
  
The (optional) conference dinner will once-again be held at [The Terrace at Trump](http://www.trumphotelcollection.com/chicago/rooftop-restaurants-chicago.php) Hotel. Overlooking the Chicago river and skyline, it is a perfect venue to continue conversations while dining and drinking.

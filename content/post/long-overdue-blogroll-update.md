I don't think I've updated my blogroll for at least a year... shame on me.  
  
This update is mostly additions.  I only removed Max Dama's blog, and that was only because it no longer exists.  I left Skill Analytics because it contains excellent information, even though Damian hasn't posted in a long time.  
  
The additions are:  
[Portfolio Probe](http://www.portfolioprobe.com/blog/)  
[The Physics of Finance](http://physicsoffinance.blogspot.com/)  
[Condor Options](http://seekingalpha.com/author/condor-options/articles)  
[Milktrader](http://www.milktrader.net/)  
[Algorithm Zoo](http://algorithmzoo.com/) (by Milktrader)[  
SEF-Blog: Signal Extraction and Forecasting](http://blog.zhaw.ch/idp/sefblog/)  
[Systematic Investor](http://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/)

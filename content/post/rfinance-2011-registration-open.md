The registration for R/Finance 2011--which will take place April 29 and 30 in Chicago--is NOW OPEN!  
  
Building on the success of the two previous conferences in 2009 and 2010, we are expecting more than 250 attendees from around the world representing both industry and academia to join a record 30+ presentations covering all areas of finance with R.  
  
This year we are excited to have longer tutorial sessions and an optional full-day workshop on the Thursday before the conference. In addition, we have worked hard to extend the great networking opportunities on both days with longer breaks and more hallway time between sessions.  
  
New for 2011 is a special conference dinner that is held on Friday evening. Overlooking the river from the famed Chicago Mercantile Exchange, we have designed it to be a great way to continue the conversations from the first day, as well as offering a chance to dine and drink in Chicago style.

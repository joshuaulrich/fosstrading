In November, I used the strategy in [Mebane Faber's](http://www.mebanefaber.com/) Tactical Asset Allocation [paper](http://ssrn.com/abstract=962461) to provide an [introduction to blotter](http://blog.fosstrading.com/2009/11/tactical-asset-allocation-using-blotter.html). Faber has [updated the strategy's results](http://web.archive.org/web/20111105055845/http://www.mebanefaber.com/2010/02/05/quant-approach-to-taa-updated-for-2009/) through the end of 2009. For those interested, he expands on the paper in his book, [The Ivy Portfolio](https://amzn.to/429jDKP).

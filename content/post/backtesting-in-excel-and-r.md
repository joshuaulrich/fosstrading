This post is the introduction to a series that will illustrate how to backtest the same strategy in Excel and R.  The impetus for this series started with [this tweet](http://twitter.com/#%21/CondorOptions/status/27254925279) by [Jared Woodard](http://twitter.com/#%21/CondorOptions) at [Condor Options](http://www.condoroptions.com/).  After [Soren Macbeth](http://about.me/soren/bio) introduced us, Jared suggested  backtesting a simple [DVI](http://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/07/29/dvi-and-spy-performance/) strategy in Excel and R.  
  
The three-post series will show you:  

1.  [Resources that make it easier to move from Excel to R](http://blog.fosstrading.com/2011/03/moving-from-excel-to-r.html)
2.  [How to test DVI in Excel](http://blog.fosstrading.com/2011/03/how-to-backtest-strategy-in-excel.html)
3.  [How to test DVI in R](http://blog.fosstrading.com/2011/03/how-to-backtest-strategy-in-r.html)

Since I know next to nothing about testing strategies in Excel, I will be writing posts 1 and 3.  Jared was kind enough to create the Excel framework for post 2, but did not have time to devote to a full post.  Thankfully, [Damian Roskill](http://etfprophet.com/author/skill-analytics/) has agreed to write post 2 using Jared's Excel file.  
  
Hopefully this will be a useful example for those of you who currently use Excel but would like to explore how to use R.

[Dirk Eddelbuettel](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/) has recently released [RQuantLib-0.3.7](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2011/04/04/#rquantlib_0.3.7), which contains the necessary QuantLib builds to allow the CRAN servers to build the Windows binary.  
  
This (thankfully) makes my post on [how to build RQuantLib on 32-bit Windows](http://blog.fosstrading.com/2010/12/build-rquantlib-on-32-bit-windows.html) unnecessary for casual users, but may be useful for those who want to develop RQuantLib on Windows.
